For Business Customers with multiple users, if a\r\n            user has access to Statements such user will be able to view all accounts on\r\n            a combined statement as long as such user has \"View\" access to at least one\r\n            of the accounts on a combined statement.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p class=\"page-number\">\r\n            <span></span>\r\n            <span></span>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <li>\r\n            <span class=\"blue-text\">Statement Election.</span>\r\n            When you elect to receive electronic statements by\r\n            selecting the \"Electronic Statement\" option, you will no longer receive\r\n            paper statements.

First, these additional\r\n                    services allow you to send money to people if you provide the Eligible\r\n                    Transaction Account information and other contact information for the\r\n                    Receiver; such transactions are not sent via Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>. Second,\r\n                    outside Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, we allow you to establish a one-time payment for\r\n                    a payment recipient for which processing shall be initiated at a later\r\n                    specified date up to one (1) year. Third, outside Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, we\r\n                    enable you to establish a recurring series of payments to a payment\r\n                    recipient for which processing shall be initiated on dates you specify.\r\n                    These three payment services and any other payment services that we provide\r\n                    under these Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> and Other Payment Terms are referred to as\r\n                    \"Other Payment Services\" in these Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> and Other Payment\r\n                    Terms. Although future-dated payments and recurring payments are outside\r\n                    Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, we may ultimately send those transactions via Zelle<sup>\r\n                        &#174;</sup> when the applicable date of payment arrives, in which case the\r\n                    applicable payment transaction is part of the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment\r\n                    Service, not the Other Payment Services. The term \"Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> and\r\n                    Other Payment Services\" means the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment Service and the\r\n                    Other Payment Services.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>The Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> and Other Payment Services enable\r\n                    you: (1) to initiate a Payment Instruction from an Eligible Transaction\r\n                    Account to an account at a U.S. financial institution; and/or (2) to receive\r\n                    a payment from another person into an Eligible Transaction Account, in U.S.\r\n                    dollars. All payments must be made through the Site and are subject to the\r\n                    terms of this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations, in each case as\r\n                    in effect from time to time. Receipt of payments may be made through the\r\n                    Site and is subject to the terms of this Agreement and applicable laws and\r\n                    regulations, in each case as in effect from time to time. In some instances,\r\n                    receipt of payments may be made through other locations besides our Site,\r\n                    such as the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> mobile handset application (\"Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n                    Standalone Locations\") and if you choose to initiate\r\n                    or receive a payment at a Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Standalone Location\r\n                    you acknowledge and agree that you shall be subject to the terms of other\r\n                    agreements, including, but not limited to, the \"terms of use\" for the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n                    Standalone Locations and applicable laws and\r\n                    regulations, in each case as in effect from time to time.

We are not\r\n                    responsible for the performance, speed, or other acts or omissions of the\r\n                    Payment Networks that may be involved in the transmission of a payment. We\r\n                    shall not be obligated to comply with the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH)\r\n                    Rules in such recovery efforts or otherwise in connection with Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n                    and Other Payments unless the applicable transaction\r\n                    is transmitted through the ACH network.

When you enroll to use the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment\r\n                    Service or when you permit others to whom you have delegated to act on your\r\n                    behalf to use or access the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment Service, you agree to\r\n                    the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

If a User sends you money using a different U.S.\r\n                    mobile number or email address that they may have for you (one that is not\r\n                    already enrolled), you will receive a message with instructions on how to\r\n                    enroll with Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    When you enroll with Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, you may establish one or more\r\n                    profiles. Each profile may be linked to only one bank account or debit card,\r\n                    but you may enroll multiple email addresses or mobile phone numbers in each\r\n                    profile. Once you have enrolled an email address or a mobile phone number\r\n                    with a profile, you may not use that same email address or phone number with\r\n                    any other profile.

When a Sender initiates a\r\n                    Payment Instruction, the Receiver is not required to accept the payment if\r\n                    the Receiver has not enrolled in Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>. You agree that you as a\r\n                    Sender will not hold us liable for any damages resulting from a Receiver not\r\n                    enrolling in Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>. For the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment Service,\r\n                    you may only cancel a payment if the person to whom you sent the money has\r\n                    not yet enrolled in the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment Service. As to the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n                    Payment Service, if the person you sent money to has already\r\n                    enrolled with Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, either in the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Standalone\r\n                    Locations or with a Network Financial Institution, then the money is sent\r\n                    directly to their bank account (except as otherwise provided below) and may\r\n                    not be canceled or revoked. Cancellation is addressed more generally in\r\n                    Section 59 (Payment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused\r\n                    Payments) below. You may initiate a one-time Payment Instruction to a\r\n                    Receiver for which processing shall be initiated immediately via Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>.\r\n                    Via the Other Payment Services, you may also initiate (a) a one-time Payment\r\n                    Instruction to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated at a later\r\n                    specified date up to one (1) year, and (b) a recurring series of Payment\r\n                    Instructions to a Receiver for which processing shall be initiated on the\r\n                    specified dates. Further details about each of these options can be found on\r\n                    the Site.</li>\r\n                <li>Payment Instructions initiated to Receivers require you to\r\n                    provide contact information about the Receiver (including an email\r\n                    address and/or mobile telephone number). If the Receiver does not bank\r\n                    at a Network Financial Institution and has not yet enrolled in\r\n                    Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, then the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Payment Service will\r\n                    contact the Receiver and request that the Receiver (i) provide\r\n                    information so that the identity of the Receiver may be validated at a\r\n                    Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup> Standalone Location and then (ii) provide Eligible\r\n                    Transaction Account information in order to complete the Payment\r\n                    Instruction (a \"Two-Step Transfer\"). If the Receiver maintains an\r\n                    Eligible Transaction Account with a Network Financial Institution and\r\n                    has not yet enrolled in Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, then the Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n                    Payment Service will contact the Receiver regarding enrollment in Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n                    and receipt of payment. If the Receiver has already\r\n                    enrolled in Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, then the Receiver will receive a message\r\n                    regarding your payment.</li>\r\n                <li>Via the Other Payment Services, we also support the sending of money\r\n                    to Receivers if you provide the Eligible Transaction Account information for\r\n                    the Receiver and other contact information for the Receiver; such\r\n                    transactions are not sent via Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>. You acknowledge and agree\r\n                    that if your Payment Instructions identify an account by name and account\r\n                    number, the relevant financial institution may execute those Payment\r\n                    Instructions by reference to the account number only, even if such account\r\n                    number does not correspond to the account name.

You\r\n                    understand and acknowledge that a person to whom you are sending money and\r\n                    who is not enrolling as a User may fail to enroll with Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>, or\r\n                    otherwise ignore the payment notification, and the transfer may not occur.\r\n                    The money may also be delayed or the transfer may be blocked to prevent\r\n                    fraud or comply with regulatory requirements. If we delay or block a payment\r\n                    that you have initiated, we will notify you in accordance with your User\r\n                    preferences (i.e., email, push notification).

However, you and\r\n                    the Receiver should not expect the payment funds to be transferred into the\r\n                    Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account any earlier than the next Business\r\n                    Day after you initiated the Payment Instruction. As part of the Other\r\n                    Payment Services, if you request a one-time Payment Instruction to be\r\n                    initiated on a specified date or a recurring series of Payment Instruction\r\n                    to be initiated on specified dates, then the processing of the Payment\r\n                    Instruction will begin on the specified date and the debiting of your\r\n                    Eligible Transaction Account will occur as early as the specified date(s).\r\n                    However, you and the Receiver should not expect the payment funds to be\r\n                    transferred into the Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account any earlier\r\n                    than the next Business Day following the specified date.

Our ability to stop a\r\n            Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment\r\n            Instruction will depend on the manner in which the Payment Instruction was\r\n            initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction to the Receiver's Eligible\r\n            Transaction Account has begun processing. Although we will make a reasonable\r\n            effort to accommodate a stop payment request and to recover funds associated\r\n            with an unauthorized Payment Instruction, we will have no liability for\r\n            failing to do so. We may also require you to present your stop payment\r\n            request or request to recover funds in writing within fourteen (14) days\r\n            after contacting customer care. If we charge you to stop the payment or\r\n            recover funds, then the charge for each stop payment or fund recovery\r\n            request will be the current charge as set out in our current fee schedule.\r\n            Payments not claimed by a Receiver who has not enrolled in Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n            will be automatically cancelled fourteen (14) days after the processing of\r\n            the payment begins. We will, to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable\r\n            attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied\r\n            payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or use other reasonable efforts\r\n            to return such payment to you as permitted by law.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <span class=\"blue-text\">Consent to Emails and Automated Text Messages.</span>\r\n            Section 132 (Text Messages, Calls and/or Emails to You) does not apply to Zelle<sup>&#174;</sup>\r\n            Payment Services.

The images of an item transmitted\r\n            to us using the Mobile Deposit Service must be legible, as determined in our\r\n            sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, the image quality of the\r\n            items must comply with the requirements established from time to time by us,\r\n            ANSI, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, or any other\r\n            regulatory agency, clearinghouse or association.

Our\r\n            notice to you shall be sent to the most recent address for you in our files.\r\n            If a party files a lawsuit in court asserting a Claim and the other party\r\n            elects arbitration, such notice may be asserted in papers filed in the\r\n            lawsuit. For example, a motion by the defendant to compel arbitration of\r\n            Claims asserted by the plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in court, will serve as\r\n            notice. If you or we commence litigation of a Claim, neither you nor we\r\n            waive our right to elect arbitration with respect to any counterclaim or\r\n            other claim that you or we may make. In the event that a court grants a\r\n            motion to compel arbitration, either party may commence the arbitration\r\n            proceeding in accordance with the rules and procedures of the arbitration\r\n            administrator selected pursuant to the section below titled \"Arbitration\r\n            Administrator and Rules.\"\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <span class=\"blue-text\">Arbitration\r\n                Administrator and Rules.</span>\r\n            The party electing arbitration\r\n            must choose between one of two administrators: (1) Dispute Prevention and\r\n            Resolution, Inc. (\"DPR\"), or (2) JAMS. The administrator chosen will apply\r\n            its rules and/or codes of procedures in effect at the time arbitration is\r\n            elected. You may obtain a copy of the rules/codes, and more information\r\n            about initiating an arbitration, by (1) contacting DPR at (808) 523-1234 or\r\n            visiting https://dprhawaii.com/, or (2) contacting JAMS at (800) 352-5267 or\r\n            visiting www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this\r\n            Arbitration Provision.
